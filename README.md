Tonus
=====

terminal-script in python for :  
 - manage lots of things in a future eventually future;
 - agregate RSS today.
But i think it's a bad idea to allow Tonus to make other things.

 
## Use
Launch tonus.py with python2.  
You must have feedparser and pickle modules installed.


## Ouch !
If there is an error, it's normal.
Tonus is completely unoptimized and almost unusable.  
In my home, it works perfectly, but for installation, i have to write myself the pickle file.  
I think it will the same problem for you, sorry.  


## End words
One day, i will recode Tonus.  
This is not a prophecy.
